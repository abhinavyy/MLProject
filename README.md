### **Student Exam Performance Indicator**

**Project Overview**:  
This project is a machine learning application built to predict students' exam performance based on various demographic and academic features. The goal is to help educational institutions, parents, and students themselves understand the factors influencing exam scores and make data-driven decisions to improve performance.

The application takes inputs such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course completion, and individual writing and reading scores to predict the overall exam score. This system aims to provide actionable insights into student performance using predictive analytics.

### **Key Features**:

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application where users can input their data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, scores) to receive predictions about exam performance.
- **Model Prediction**: The backend employs a trained machine learning model to predict students' performance, leveraging a variety of features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The pipeline includes data transformation and scaling to ensure accurate predictions.
